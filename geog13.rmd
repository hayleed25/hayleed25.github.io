In the summer of 2021 I took a GIS based course based in R through UC Santa Barbara. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

## [Building a project website](https://github.com/hayleed25/hayleed25.github.io.git)

- In this assignment I used Github to build websites and repositories
- I learned how to use R and how to knit into a html
- I know how to push files from R to Github

## [Labs](https://haylee65.wixsite.com/website/blog)
For another class, I had to publish all of my work to a website. It is a collection of a series of labs, ranging from QGIS to Google Earth labs. Here, take a look.
