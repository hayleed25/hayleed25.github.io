In the summer of 2021 I took a GIS based course in R Studio through UC Santa Barbara. I wrote some code and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

## [Lab 1](https://hayleed25.github.io/index.html)

- In this assignment I used Github to build websites and repositories
- I learned how to use R and how to knit into a html
- I know how to push files from R to Github

## [Lab 2](https://hayleed25.github.io/lab-02.html)

- For this assignment, I used packages of tidyverse 
- Each package was used to analyze specific COVID-19 data
- The lab was intended to practice data wrangling and visualization skills

## [Lab 3](https://hayleed25.github.io/lab-03.html)

- This lab was my favorite!
- I used spatial features (sf) and objects to create distances and projects
- I especially enjoyed working with ggplot to create maps, and using fun colors for filtering in data

## [Lab 4](https://hayleed25.github.io/lab04.html)
- For me, this lab was the most challenging, yet most pleasing
- This lab required reading in Nation Dams to answer questions of geometry simplification, centroid generation, and tessellations
- It was the most pleasing because of the voroni, triangulation, square and hexagonal graphs of the United States ![lab 4](~/Github/Geog-13-Labs/LAB01/rugby.img/lab3.png)

## [Geography 183](https://haylee65.wixsite.com/website/blog)
- For another class, I had to publish all of my work to a website. It is a collection of a series of labs, ranging from QGIS to Google Earth labs. Here, take a look.

- Current Fall 2021 class using ArcGIS Pro and other related GIS applications.
