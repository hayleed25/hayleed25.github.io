# Hi, I'm Haylee Damron.

I am a current student at UC Santa Barbara studying Geography with an emphasis on GIS. This is my first data science class that I have taken, and I have to say it has been a fun challenge. In the future, I hope to attend graduate school and study fire patterns and how firefighters can attack fires quickly. I also hope to study city planning and first responders' routes. 
In my free time I love to read, hike, take boxing classes and surf. I am also on the UC Santa Barbara rugby team and love playing that sport! Here is a picture of myself and some teammates after a huge win in Arizona!
